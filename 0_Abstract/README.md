-It is commonly read in the Newspaper about the Smuggling of the Trees such as Sandal,Teak etc taking place throughout the world. Since the demands for these trees are more, the cost of such trees is also high. By selling the woods of such trees, a huge amount can be earned and hencethe smuggling of such trees may take place which is considered to be an illegal act. In order to prohibit the illegal smuggling of these trees some measures are to be undertaken. The main objective of this system is to restrict the smuggling and save the valuable trees so to maintain balanced eco-system by preventing deforestation. The system uses the GPS technology from which we can find the location of the tree where the poaching is done. The system also uses a chip (board) on which various Sensors (such as Flex Sensor and Fire Sensor) are embedded which are controlled through IoT.
