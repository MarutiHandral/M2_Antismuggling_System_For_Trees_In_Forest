In this project Renesas microcontroller is the heart of the project, located at the center of 
the block diagram and controls all the operations of the system. An LCD is used to display all 
the operations going on inside the microcontroller. This unit would consist of three sensors to 
give the information of getting Cut Down the trees, Damage with fire, etc. 
The tree unit would be the primary unit for the implementation of the system. The tree 
unit consists of three sensors:
1. Accelerometer Sensor.
2. Fire Sensor.
3. Temperature Sensor. 
 These sensors would be responsible to send the data to the controller on the tree 
unit which would be then transmitted to the next stage i.e, Tree Unit to the tree unit which 
has IoT, for further processing to Base station. This is the second and last stage of the 
system which would be responsible for gathering the data and facilitate the same to the
